utilizing React's setState method and setTimeout. Exercise in working with manipulating state on lower
level components.

##Features

- Year box (starting with this year)
- Three buttons (one to count forwards, one to count backwards, and one to stop time and
"live in the moment")
- Year box changes color based on counting being forwards or backwards
